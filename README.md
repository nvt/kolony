# Kolony

Kolony is a Kubernetes operator for managing ColonyOS resources declaratively. It enables GitOps workflows for ColonyOS by providing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that sync with the ColonyOS API.

## Why Kolony?

### Kubernetes Reconciliation for Cyber-Physical Systems

Kubernetes has revolutionized how we manage cloud infrastructure through declarative configuration and continuous reconciliation. However, traditional Kubernetes is limited to managing resources that run *within* the cluster - containers, services, and cloud-native workloads.

**Kolony extends the Kubernetes reconciliation model to the physical world.**

Through ColonyOS executors, Kolony can reconcile state across systems that cannot run Kubernetes themselves:

- **IoT and Embedded Systems** - Sensors, PLCs, industrial controllers, and edge devices with limited compute resources
- **Legacy Infrastructure** - SCADA systems, proprietary hardware, and brownfield installations
- **Remote and Harsh Environments** - Mining sites, offshore platforms, Arctic installations with intermittent connectivity
- **Specialized Hardware** - GPUs, FPGAs, quantum computers, and domain-specific accelerators

### Unified Control Plane for Heterogeneous Infrastructure

Modern organizations operate across multiple compute paradigms:

| Environment | Traditional Management | With Kolony |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) | Terraform, CloudFormation | Kubernetes + Kolony |
| On-premise Kubernetes | kubectl, Helm | Kubernetes + Kolony |
| HPC Clusters | SLURM scripts, manual | Kubernetes + Kolony |
| Edge/IoT | Vendor-specific tools | Kubernetes + Kolony |
| Industrial OT | SCADA, proprietary | Kubernetes + Kolony |

Kolony provides a **single declarative interface** for all these environments, managed through familiar Kubernetes tooling.

### HPC Integration

High-Performance Computing clusters represent massive computational resources that traditionally operate in isolation from cloud-native infrastructure. Kolony bridges this gap:

- **Submit HPC jobs from Kubernetes** - Define SLURM/PBS jobs as ColonyProcess resources
- **Declarative cluster configuration** - Manage HPC software stacks, modules, and environments via Blueprints
- **Hybrid workflows** - Orchestrate pipelines that span Kubernetes and HPC seamlessly
- **Resource federation** - Treat HPC clusters as executor pools alongside cloud resources
- **Burst to HPC** - Automatically offload compute-intensive workloads when cluster capacity is available

### GitOps for Everything

By representing physical infrastructure as Kubernetes resources, Kolony enables:

- **Version-controlled infrastructure** - Git history for industrial control systems, not just cloud resources
- **Pull request workflows** - Review changes to PLC configurations like code
- **Audit trails** - Full traceability of who changed what, when
- **Rollback capabilities** - Revert physical infrastructure to previous states
- **Environment promotion** - Dev -> Staging -> Production for cyber-physical systems

### Bridge Between IT and OT

Operational Technology (OT) - the systems that control physical processes - has historically been siloed from Information Technology (IT). Kolony bridges this divide:

- **Common tooling** - Platform engineers and OT engineers use the same kubectl/GitOps workflows
- **Unified observability** - Correlate cloud metrics with industrial sensor data
- **Consistent security model** - Apply Kubernetes RBAC to physical infrastructure access
- **Integrated CI/CD** - Deploy firmware updates and control system changes through the same pipelines as application code

### Edge Computing with Resilience

For remote sites with unreliable connectivity, Kolony combined with ColonyOS edge executors provides:

- **Offline operation** - Edge executors continue operating during network outages
- **Store-and-forward** - Jobs queue locally and sync when connectivity returns
- **Local reconciliation** - Critical control loops run at the edge, not dependent on cloud
- **Eventual consistency** - Kubernetes desired state propagates to edge when possible

### Eclipse Arrowhead Integration

[Eclipse Arrowhead](https://arrowhead.eu/eclipse-arrowhead-2/) is a service-oriented framework for industrial automation and Industry 4.0, enabling interoperability across heterogeneous IoT/OT environments. It organizes systems into **Local Clouds** - closed, local industrial networks at the edge - each containing three mandatory core systems:

- **Service Registry** - Service discovery for industrial microsystems
- **Orchestrator** - Determines which service instances consumers should use
- **Authorization** - X.509 certificate and JWT-based access control

Kolony enables **Kubernetes-native management of Arrowhead infrastructure**:

| Arrowhead Concept | Kolony Blueprint | Description |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Local Cloud | `ArrowheadLocalCloud` | Deploy and configure an Arrowhead local cloud |
| Service Registry | `ArrowheadService` | Register/deregister services declaratively |
| Orchestration Rules | `ArrowheadOrchestration` | Define consumer-provider bindings as code |
| Authorization | `ArrowheadAuthorization` | Manage access policies via GitOps |
| Inter-Cloud | `ArrowheadGatekeeper` | Configure cross-cloud service exchange |

**Why this matters:**

- **GitOps for industrial automation** - Version-controlled Arrowhead configurations with PR-based review
- **Unified management** - Same kubectl/Helm workflows for cloud services and factory floor
- **Declarative service mesh** - Define the entire Arrowhead topology as Kubernetes resources
- **Hybrid architectures** - Orchestrate workloads across Kubernetes, Arrowhead local clouds, and HPC
- **Protocol bridging** - ColonyOS executors can translate between Arrowhead services and OPC-UA, Modbus, Z-Wave, IO-Link

Example: Deploying an Arrowhead service via Kolony:

```yaml
apiVersion: colony.colonyos.io/v1
kind: Blueprint
metadata:
  name: temperature-sensor-service
  namespace: factory-floor
spec:
  kind: ArrowheadService
  data:
    localCloud: "production-line-1"
    service:
      name: "temperature-monitoring"
      uri: "/sensor/temperature"
      interface: "HTTP-SECURE-JSON"
      version: 1
    provider:
      systemName: "plc-sensor-gateway"
      address: "192.168.10.50"
      port: 8443
    metadata:
      unit: "celsius"
      location: "furnace-zone-a"
```

This enables industrial systems to be managed with the same rigor and tooling as cloud-native applications, bringing DevOps practices to the factory floor.

## Overview

Kolony bridges Kubernetes and ColonyOS, allowing you to:

- Define BlueprintDefinitions and Blueprints as Kubernetes resources
- Submit jobs to ColonyOS executors via ColonyProcess resources
- Track process state and output in Kubernetes status fields
- Use GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux) to manage ColonyOS infrastructure

## Custom Resources

| CRD | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `BlueprintDefinition` | Defines a schema for a type of blueprint (similar to CRDs for custom resources) |
| `Blueprint` | An instance of a BlueprintDefinition representing desired state |
| `ColonyProcess` | A job-like resource that submits functions to ColonyOS and tracks execution |

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster v1.24+
- Helm v3.0+
- Access to a ColonyOS server
- ColonyOS executor private key

## Installation

### Using Helm

```bash
# Add the kolony namespace
kubectl create namespace kolony

# Install the operator
helm install kolony ./helm/kolony --namespace kolony
```

### From Pre-built Image

The operator image is available at `colonyos/kolony:latest`:

```bash
helm install kolony ./helm/kolony \
  --namespace kolony \
  --set image.repository=colonyos/kolony \
  --set image.tag=latest
```

## Configuration

### ColonyOS Credentials

The operator reads ColonyOS credentials from a Kubernetes Secret named `colonyos-credentials` in each namespace where you create Kolony resources.

Create the secret in your target namespace:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic colonyos-credentials \
  --namespace=<your-namespace> \
  --from-literal=serverHost="<colonyos-server-host>" \
  --from-literal=serverPort="<colonyos-server-port>" \
  --from-literal=tls="<true-or-false>" \
  --from-literal=colonyName="<your-colony-name>" \
  --from-literal=colonyPrvKey="<your-colony-private-key>" \
  --from-literal=executorPrvKey="<your-executor-private-key>"
```

Or apply a YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: colonyos-credentials
  namespace: <your-namespace>
type: Opaque
stringData:
  serverHost: "<colonyos-server-host>"
  serverPort: "<colonyos-server-port>"
  tls: "<true-or-false>"
  colonyName: "<your-colony-name>"
  colonyPrvKey: "<your-colony-private-key>"
  executorPrvKey: "<your-executor-private-key>"
```

**Note:** Two private keys are required:
- `colonyPrvKey`: Colony-level key for BlueprintDefinition operations
- `executorPrvKey`: Executor-level key for Blueprint and ColonyProcess operations

**Important:** Never commit credentials to version control. Use sealed-secrets or external secret management in production.

### Default Credentials

Some tools create resources in namespaces they generate on the fly, for example a fresh namespace per request or per tenant, and cannot place a credentials Secret there first. For these, point the operator at one shared Secret with `--default-credentials-secret=<namespace>/<name>`, or the Helm value `defaultCredentialsSecret`. A `colonyos-credentials` Secret in the resource's own namespace still takes precedence.

The default Secret is used for Blueprints and ColonyProcesses only. BlueprintDefinitions are colony-wide and need the colony key, so they always need a `colonyos-credentials` Secret in their own namespace. The default Secret therefore needs no `colonyPrvKey`; leave it out so that the fallback cannot act as the colony owner.

Unless narrowed as described below, the default Secret applies to every namespace: anyone who can create a Blueprint or ColonyProcess in any namespace then acts with its executor key. Only enable it where that is acceptable, and restrict who can create these resources with RBAC.

To narrow the fallback, set `--default-credentials-namespace-selector` (Helm value `defaultCredentialsNamespaceSelector`) to a label selector. Only namespaces whose labels match it then fall back to the default Secret. Creating or labelling a namespace needs cluster-level rights, so this keeps the default Secret out of namespaces that ordinary users control. If the tool that creates the namespaces labels them, select on that label, for example `--default-credentials-namespace-selector=example.com/provisioned`.

When a resource is deleted and no credentials can be found for it at all, the operator logs an error and removes the finalizer anyway. This stops the namespace from hanging in `Terminating`, but the object is left behind in ColonyOS.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains ready-to-use YAML files:

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `credentials-secret.yaml` | Template for ColonyOS credentials |
| `colonyprocess-simple.yaml` | Simple hello world container |
| `colonyprocess-docker-executor.yaml` | Container with echo, date, hostname |

### Quick Start with Examples

```bash
# 1. Create credentials (edit with your values first!)
cp examples/credentials-secret.yaml my-credentials.yaml
# Edit my-credentials.yaml with your ColonyOS credentials
kubectl apply -f my-credentials.yaml

# 2. Submit a process (use 'create' with generateName)
kubectl create -f examples/colonyprocess-simple.yaml

# 3. Watch status
kubectl get colonyprocess -w
```

### Checking Status

```bash
# List all resources
kubectl get blueprintdefinitions
kubectl get blueprints
kubectl get colonyprocesses

# Get detailed status
kubectl describe colonyprocess <name>

# View full status
kubectl get colonyprocess <name> -o yaml
```

### Status Fields

ColonyProcess status includes:
- `processId`: ColonyOS process ID
- `state`: Pending, Waiting, Running, Success, or Failed
- `assignedExecutor`: Which executor is running the job
- `output`: Explicit return values from the executor (not stdout)
- `errors`: Any error messages

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for more details
